-- execution plan in SQL
/*
An execution plan is basically a road map that graphically or textually shows the data retrieval methods chosen by the 
SQL server’s query optimizer for a stored procedure or ad hoc query. Execution plans are very useful for helping a 
developer understand and analyze the performance characteristics of a query or stored procedure */

-- Explain ACID concepts
/*
Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability

Atomicity => Atomicity requires that each transaction be “all or nothing”: if one part of the transaction fails, the 
entire transaction fails, and the database state is left unchanged. An atomic system must guarantee atomicity in each 
and every situation, including power failures, errors, and crashes.

Consistency => The consistency property ensures that any transaction will bring the database from one valid state to 
another. Any data written to the database must be valid according to all defined rules, including constraints, cascades, 
triggers, and any combination thereof.

Isolation => The isolation property ensures that the concurrent execution of transactions results in a system state that 
would be obtained if transactions were executed serially, i.e., one after the other. Providing isolation is the main goal
of concurrency control. Depending on concurrency control method (i.e. if it uses strict - as opposed to relaxed - serializability), 
the effects of an incomplete transaction might not even be visible to another transaction.

Durability => Durability means that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so, even in the event of power 
loss, crashes, or errors. In a relational database, for instance, once a group of SQL statements execute, the results 
need to be stored permanently (even if the database crashes immediately thereafter). To defend against power loss, 
transactions (or their effects) must be recorded in a non-volatile memory. */


-- Given a table dbo.users where the column user_id is a unique numeric identifier, how can you efficiently select the 
-- first 100 odd user_id values from the table? (Assume the table contains well over 100 records with odd user_id values.)
SELECT TOP 100 user_id FROM dbo.users WHERE user_id % 2 = 1 ORDER BY user_id


-- What is the difference between the WHERE and HAVING clauses?
/*
When GROUP BY is not used, the WHERE and HAVING clauses are essentially equivalent
However, when GROUP BY is used:
The WHERE clause is used to filter records from a result. The filtering occurs BEFORE any groupings are made.
The HAVING clause is used to filter values from a group 
(i.e., to check conditions after aggregation into groups has been performed). */

-- Given a table Employee having columns empName and empId, what will be the result of the SQL query below?
select empName from Employee order by 2 desc; 
/* it will throw an error, because even though the table has 2 columns, here we only selected on of them */


-- Varchar vs Char
/*
When stored in a database, varchar uses only the allocated space. E.g. if you have a varchar(1999) and put 50 bytes 
in the table, it will use 52 bytes.

But when stored in a database, char always uses the maximum length and is blank-padded. E.g. if you have char(1999) 
and put 50 bytes in the table, it will consume 2000 bytes.
