itself to capture and analyse data. the data stored in the database can be modified, retrieved and deleted.
and can be of any tpe like strings, numbers, images, etc...

Schema vs Database

a database is the main container, it contains data and log files, and all schemas within it, you can always backup
a database, it is a discrete unit on its own.

Schemas are like folders within a database, and are mainly used to group logical objects together, which leads to ease of
setting permissions by schema.

schema should be created inside a database. the basic syntax of CREATE SCHEMA is as follows:
CREATE SCHEMA name;

-- INDEX
/*
Indexes are special lookup tables that the database search engine can use to speed up data retrieval. Simply put, an index is a
pointer to data in a table. An index in a database is very similar to an index in the back of a book. For example, if you want
to reference all pages in a book that discusses a certain topic, you have to first refer to the index, which lists all topics
alphabetically and then refer to one or more specific page numbers. An index helps to speed up SELECT queries and WHERE clauses;
however, it slows down data input, with UPDATE and INSERT statements. Indexes can be created or dropped with no effect on the data.
*/

CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name
[USING method]
(
    column_name [ASC | DESC] [NULL {FIRST | LAST}],
    ...
);

/* First, specify the index name after the "CREATE INDEX" clause. The index name should be meaningful and easy to remember.
Second, specify the name of the table to which the index belongs to. Third, specify the index method such as btree, hash,
gist, spgist, gin, and brin.
POSTGRES uses btree by default.
Fourth, list one or more columns that to be stored in the index. The ASC and DESC specify the sort order.
ASC is the default. NULLS FIRST or NULLS LAST specifies nulls sort before or after non-nulls.
The NULLS FIRST is the default when DESC is specified and NULLS LAST is the default when DESC is not specified.
 */

-- CONSTRAINTS | UNIQUE | CHECK

-- check if there are any duplicate emails

-- Add unique constraint to emails, here we gave it a name but it is not necessary:
-- unique constraint can’t be used to identify rows (unlike primary key)

-- how to delete only 1 row:

-- Truncate
/*
The PostgreSQL TRUNCATE TABLE command is used to delete complete data from an existing table. You can also use DROP TABLE
command to delete complete table but it would remove table structure from the database and you would need to re-create this
table once again if you wish to store some data.
It has the same effect as DELETE on each table, but since it does not actually scan the tables, it is faster. Furthermore,
it reclaims disk space immediately, rather than requiring a subsequent VACUUM operation. This is most useful on large tables.

-- TRANSACTION
/*
A transaction is a unit of work that is performed against a database. Transactions are units or sequences of work accomplished in a
logical order, whether in a manual fashion by a user or automatically by some sort of a database program.

A transaction is the propagation of one or more changes to the database. For example, if you are creating a record, updating a record,
or deleting a record from the table, then you are performing transaction on the table. It is important to control transactions to
ensure data integrity and to handle database errors.

-- FUNCTION | Stored Procedure
/*
functions, also known as Stored Procedures, allow you to carry out operations that would normally take several queries and round
trips in a single function within the database. Functions allow database to reuse as other applications can interact directly with your
stored procedures instead of a middle-tier or duplicating code.

There are several built-in postgres functions: Count - Max - Min - Avg - Sum - Array - Numeric
PostgreSQL ARRAY_AGG function is used to concatenate the input values including null into an array.
SELECT ARRAY_AGG(SALARY) FROM COMPANY; => {20000,15000,20000,65000,85000,45000,10000}

-- Trigger
/* Triggers are database callback functions, which are automatically performed/invoked when a specified database event occurs.
triggers in SQL are spacial type of store procedures that are defined to execute automatically in place or after data modifications. it allows you
to execute a batch of code when an insert, update or any other query is executed against the table.

before insert : activated before data is inserted into the table
after insert : activated after data is inserted into the table
before update : activated before data in the table is updated
after update : activated after data in the table is updated
before delete : activated before data is removed from the table
after delete : activated after data is removed from the table

A trigger that is marked FOR EACH ROW is called once for every row that the operation modifies. In contrast, a trigger that is marked
FOR EACH STATEMENT only executes once for any given operation, regardless of how many rows it modifies.
If multiple triggers of the same kind are defined for the same event, they will be fired in alphabetical order by name.
The BEFORE, AFTER or INSTEAD OF keyword determines when the trigger actions will be executed relative to the insertion,
modification or removal of the associated row
Triggers are automatically dropped when the table that they are associated with is dropped.
event_name could be INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE, and TRUNCATE

-- VIEWS
/* Views are pseudo-tables. That is, they are not real tables; nevertheless appear as ordinary tables to SELECT.
A view can represent a subset of a real table, selecting certain columns or certain rows from an ordinary table. A view
can even represent joined tables. Because views are assigned separate permissions, you can use them to restrict table
access so that the users see only specific rows or columns of a table.

view is a virtual table which consists of a subset of data contained in a table. since views are not present, it takes less
space to store. Views can have data of one or more tables combined and it depends on the relationship.
